# arkanoid-grp3

### Checkout dev branch to see our development work

## Gameplay
- Use Z and S keys to move as player 1
- Use Up and Down arrows to move as player 2

The goal is to break all the "goal bricks" of your opponent.
When breaking a brick there is a random chance that a bonus will spawn. <br>
There are 3 types of bonuses:
- Speed buff
- Speed debuff
- Ball split

## Workflow
Each feature is made on its own branch. When the feature is done it's moved under the Review panel of our GitKraken Board. <br>
Once in review Antoine Jeanselme will merge it on origin/dev. This branch can then be merged back on any branch to have the up to date content. <br>
